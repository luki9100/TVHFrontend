# TVHFrontend
## What this is
My own TVHeadend Frontend based on the TVH API

This is still in early stages and i am an absolute newbie to programming. So please use this at your own risk.

## What currently works:
- You can configure your URL and Port in the config.php File
- You can Login to TVH with your username and password
- The available Channels will get listed
- You can click on "Play" to play the channel (in my case this downloads a M3U file, which I can open with VLC)

## ToDo:
- TVHFrontend without BasicAuth
- Advanced EPG
- maybe some Options to configure TVH, but I need to see what I can do with the API
- maybe a HTML5 Player, but no Idea if that works with M3U
